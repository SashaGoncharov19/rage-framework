To make you life easier while using RageFW we created a basic CLI. At the moment automation we have only works via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) and [bun](https://bun.sh/)

``pnpm create @entityseven/rage-fw@latest``

``bun create @entityseven/rage-fw@latest``

# TL;DR
- ``Initialize new project`` - create new template project
- ``Test our RPC`` - scaffold an example for ``@entityseven/rage-fw-rpc``
- ``Install RAGE:MP updater`` - download and update RAGE:MP server files

# Options
For now, you will see a few available options. They are described in detail below

- ``Initialize new project``
- ``Test our RPC``
- ``Install RAGE:MP updater``

## Initialize new project
Using this option will forward you to common project creation menu

- ``Enter project name``
  This option will specify a name for your project which is used as a folder name too. Defaults to **rage-fw-example**

- ``Select front-end``
  Use selector menu to choose which front-end framework you want to use. We will do our best to expand this menu with various solutions

## Test our RPC

- ``Enter project name``
  This option will specify a name for your project which is used as a folder name too. Defaults to **rage-fw-rpc-example**

- ``Select front-end``
