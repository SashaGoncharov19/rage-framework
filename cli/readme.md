# RageFW CLI

To make you life easier while using RageFW we created a basic CLI. At the moment automation we have only works via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/)

``pnpm create rage-fw@latest``

## TL;DR
- ``Initialize new project`` - create new template project
- ``Install RAGE:MP updater`` - download and update RAGE:MP server files

## Options
For now, you will see a few available options. They are described in detail below

- ``Initialize new project``
- ``Install RAGE:MP updater``

### Initialize new project
Using this options will forward you to common project-creation menu
- ``Enter project name`` 

This option will specify a name for your project which is used as a folder name too. Defaults to **rage-fw**

- ``Select frontend``

Use this selector menu to choose which frontend framework you want to use. We will do our best to expand this menu after some time.
Defaults to **React + TypeScript (Vite)**

### Install Rage:MP updater
This option will simplify installation process of Rage:MP server files required to start your server
